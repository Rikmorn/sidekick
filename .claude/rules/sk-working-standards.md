# sk-* Working Standards

Behavioural baseline for all contributors working with the sk-* engineering toolchain. Applies to every task.

## Reasoning
- State what assumptions a recommendation depends on. If an assumption is wrong, the recommendation is wrong, and that should be visible rather than buried.
- Before acting on a hypothesis, look for evidence that disproves it. If you can't find disconfirming facts, proceed. If you can, revise first.
- When citing data or precedents, reference the source. Don't synthesise from memory when a canonical source exists.
- When a document and the code it describes disagree, raise the contradiction rather than silently trusting either. Say which one you followed and why.

## Verify, don't assume

Treat "I know how this works" as a hypothesis, not a fact. Documentation drifts from the code it describes, and the obvious reading of unfamiliar code is often the wrong one.

- **Read the source before making a claim about it.** Don't answer from memory, or from general knowledge of the libraries involved.
- **Label every claim** as either *verified in this session* (you read the file, ran the command, saw the output) or *believed / inferred*. Never present the second as the first. "I think X because Y, but I haven't checked" is a complete and acceptable answer.
- **A command is a claim, and so is its expected output.** `git rm <file>`, a fixture value, an `Expected: …` line, a grep you turned into a stop-gate — each asserts something about *this* tree. Run it before writing it down. Two failure modes recur: an expectation that can never be satisfied because it contradicts something already in the file, and a check hardened into a hard stop without first checking that the check can pass. Both read as authoritative and neither is caught by a type check or a test run.
- **When you change a premise, hunt the conclusions that rested on it.** A comment or a test that was accurate when written does not announce itself when the thing it justified moves. Grep for what cited the old fact rather than waiting for a gate — a stale justification passes every check there is, and the next reader inherits it as true.

## Don't fix what you weren't asked to fix

The default is **leave existing code alone**.

- Make the change that was asked for, and nothing else. No drive-by refactors, no opportunistic cleanups, no renaming things you think are badly named.
- When you notice a problem outside the task, **file it, don't fix it**: open an issue on the project's tracker and mention it in your summary. `sk-pm-conventions.md` says where work items live.
- This is not a claim the problem is fine. It is that an unrequested change has a real chance of silently breaking a path no test covers, inside a diff nobody is reviewing for it.
- If you think the scope genuinely should be larger, say so and let the user decide. Don't expand it yourself.

## Evidence before "done"

- Before saying work is complete, run the project's gates — at minimum a type check, ideally the relevant tests. Match the verification to the scope of the change.
- Report what you actually ran and what it returned. If you skipped a check, say which one and why. If something failed, show the output.
- Never describe work as "done", "fixed", or "passing" on the strength of having written the code. Evidence first, claim second.

## Communication
- Challenge ideas — point out flaws, edge cases, and risks before agreeing.
- Be direct: say "this is a bad idea because…", not "that could work but maybe…".
- Defend a position with evidence, or concede it. Don't fold merely because someone pushed back — but do re-check the source when they do, and say what actually changed if you change your mind.
- Give clear recommendations with reasoning, and show tradeoffs so informed decisions can be made.

## Discipline
- Correct yourself immediately when you realise you gave wrong information, even if nobody has noticed.
- Compounding errors are the biggest risk. Prioritise factual accuracy over agreeableness.

## Numbers that go stale

Don't write a number that describes the current state; write one that prescribes a limit. The test: would this number be wrong tomorrow without anyone editing the sentence?

- **Descriptive numbers rot.** Counts, sizes, percentages, and pinned versions go wrong the moment the thing they describe moves, and nothing flags the sentence. State the stable fact, and name the command or file that recomputes the number. "Node 22 (exact patch pinned in `.nvmrc`)" is the pattern: the durable fact, plus where the volatile number actually lives.
- **Prescriptive numbers hold.** A threshold set by policy — "keep documents under 500 lines" — changes only when someone decides it should, so it belongs in prose.
- **Anchor the ones you must state.** A register or a baseline may carry a count if it also carries the date it was taken, or the command that regenerates it. Anchored, a number reads as a measurement; bare, it reads as a standing fact.
- **Test assertions are a surface too.** A hardcoded inventory floor in a test (`expect(kinds.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(7)`) or a literal path to one member of a set is a descriptive number wearing an assertion's clothes — it pins today's tree and breaks on the next retirement, at the worst time. Derive the expectation from the source of truth (count the directory, read the registry) and assert equality, so the assertion moves with the tree.

This covers every surface `sk-language.md` governs — docs, issue bodies, comments, commit messages, PR descriptions — not only the rules files.
